    <h2> Adelyn Smith</h2>
    <p>I am majoring in Web Development.</p>
    <p>I love to read, listen to music, and watch the sunsets. The sunsets are so beautiful in Idaho!</p>
    <p>I love that the people at BYU-I are kind and willing to learn.</p>
    <p>I am taking this course because I took a web design class in highschool and really enjoyed it. Learning to code is a simple step in becoming more educated about technology and <br>
        it is a skill that can benefit anybody because technology is constantly growing.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church my entire life. One of my favorite scriptures is Isaiah 43:1-2.</p>
