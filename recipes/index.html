          Kraft mac and cheese for dinner, we’ve all been there. It's easy and
          just right there, but that can’t be the only option for college
          students that just don’t know how to cook. Here, you can find simple recipes
          that aren’t difficult to follow for meals that are tasty and quick.
          This is specifically for college students that aren’t aware of
          how to create real food on their own, but it can also apply to anyone
          that isn’t good at cooking. It has also come to my attention that
          there is a frightening lack of fruits and vegetables in the meals of
          college students. Therefore, this covers the basics of how to feed
          yourself during the day and ensures there are at least some fruits and
          vegetables in your diet.
