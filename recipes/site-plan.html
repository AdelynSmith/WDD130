      Kraft mac and cheese for dinner, we’ve all been there. It's easy and just right there,
      but that can’t be the only option for college students that just don’t know how to cook.
      You can find simple recipes that aren’t difficult to follow for meals that are tasty and quick here.
      This is specifically for college students that aren’t aware of how to create real food on their own,
      but it can also apply to anyone that isn’t good at cooking. It has also come to my attention that
      there is a frightening lack of fruits and vegetables in the meals of college students.
      Therefore, this covers the basics of how to feed yourself during the day and ensures there are at
      least some fruits and vegetables in your diet.
